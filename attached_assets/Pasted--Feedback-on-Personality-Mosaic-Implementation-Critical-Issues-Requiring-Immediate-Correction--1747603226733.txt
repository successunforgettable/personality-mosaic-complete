# Feedback on Personality Mosaic Implementation

## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Correction

### 1. Terminology Compliance
- **URGENT:** The term "values" on the main screen must be replaced with "BASELINES" as explicitly required in section 1.5 of the specification
- The foundation stone content must be labeled as BASELINES, not generic values
- All user-facing text must be reviewed for terminology compliance with our requirements

### 2. Foundation Stone Design Implementation
- The current rectangular cards with photos completely deviate from the specification
- **Required Changes:**
  - Replace photo cards with hexagonal stone shapes as specified in section 3.2.1
  - Implement proper gradient backgrounds based on stone type
  - Add 2px white borders with 8px border radius
  - Apply the shadow specifications (0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.2))
  - Add hover effects (scale to 1.05× with shadow increase)
  - Add selected state visual feedback (glow effect, checkmark indicator)

### 3. Stone Content Alignment
- Current generic content (COMPASSION, ANALYSIS, PASSION) does not match our specified stone sets
- **Required Changes:**
  - Implement the exact 9 sets of stone content as detailed in section 3.3.1
  - Use the precise wording for each stone's BASELINES (e.g., "ANALYSIS • LOGIC • THINKING")
  - Apply the correct categorization (Head, Heart, Body) for proper type mapping
  - Follow the stone-to-type mapping algorithm for accurate personality assessment

## Visual Design Corrections

### 1. Overall UI Implementation
- The current interface lacks the visual richness and engagement specified
- **Required Changes:**
  - Implement the complete design system (colors, typography, spacing, shadows)
  - Apply the specified color system from section 2.1
  - Use the typography specifications from section 2.2
  - Follow spacing system from section 2.3
  - Add proper animations for selections and transitions

### 2. Foundation Visualization
- The "Your Foundation" area is empty and lacks the visualization component
- **Required Changes:**
  - Implement the circular foundation base (320px diameter)
  - Add stone placement visualization as selections are made
  - Apply proper animation for stones appearing in foundation
  - Create visual feedback for progress through the 9 sets

### 3. Progress Tracking
- Current progress indicator is basic and doesn't properly represent the 4-phase process
- **Required Changes:**
  - Enhance the progress visualization to clearly show the four distinct phases
  - Add proper styling to the current phase indicator
  - Implement appropriate navigation controls between phases
  - Add clear visual distinction for completed vs. upcoming phases

## Functionality Implementation

### 1. Stone Selection Mechanism
- The current implementation doesn't appear to track selections properly
- **Required Changes:**
  - Implement the full selection tracking algorithm from section 3.4
  - Store selections in application state
  - Calculate intermediate type probabilities after each selection
  - Ensure proper progression through all 9 stone sets

### 2. Phase Transitions
- No evidence of preparation for transitions between the four phases
- **Required Changes:**
  - Implement smooth fade transitions between phases
  - Ensure tower visualization persists and updates between phases
  - Apply the animation specifications from section 9.4.1
  - Make sure progress indicators update appropriately

### 3. Tower Building Metaphor
- The core tower-building concept is missing entirely
- **Required Changes:**
  - Begin implementing the foundation for the tower visualization
  - Prepare for the Building Block phase implementation
  - Design the visual elements needed for the complete tower
  - Set up the structure for the eventual 3D-like visualization

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Start with the Foundation:** Focus on getting the Foundation Stone phase working correctly before moving to subsequent phases
   - Correct the stone design and implementation
   - Implement the proper selection logic
   - Create the foundation visualization
   - Apply the correct terminology

2. **Follow the Phased Approach:** As outlined in section 10, build and test one phase completely before moving to the next
   - Validate each phase against specifications
   - Ensure proper data flow between phases
   - Only integrate phases after individual validation

3. **Prioritize Visual Accuracy:** Follow section 12.2 guidelines to ensure all visual elements match specifications exactly
   - Color values, sizes, spacing must be precise
   - Animations must follow timing and easing specifications
   - Component styling should strictly adhere to the design system

4. **Check Against Reference Points:** Regularly verify implementation against the specification document
   - Use the provided CSS examples and component structures
   - Reference the detailed algorithm implementations
   - Check visual elements against the design specifications

This implementation requires significant work to align with the detailed specification provided. The current version is essentially a basic placeholder that doesn't reflect the sophisticated assessment system described in our documentation.
