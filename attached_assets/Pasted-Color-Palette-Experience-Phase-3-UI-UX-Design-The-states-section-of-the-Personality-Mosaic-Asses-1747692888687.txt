Color Palette Experience (Phase 3) UI/UX Design
The "states" section of the Personality Mosaic Assessment System is designed as a Color Palette Experience where users interact with visual representations of their psychological operating states. This phase uses a painting/coloring metaphor for an engaging and intuitive experience.
Visual Layout and Interaction
The interface features five vertically arranged "paint palette" cards (200px × 120px each) representing different psychological operating states:

Very Good - Green palette (#22c55e)
Good - Teal palette (#10b981)
Average - Amber palette (#f59e0b)
Orange - Orange palette (#f97316)
Destructive - Red palette (#ef4444)

Each palette card has:

A paint palette shape with color swatches specific to that state
Gradient background matching the state's color theme
White border (2px) with rounded corners (8px radius)
Subtle shadow effect for depth
The state name and a personalized description in 16px Inter Medium font
Hover animations (slight scale increase to 1.03× and shadow enhancement)
Selected state indication (glow effect and checkmark)

User Flow

Users are presented with instructions: "Select the two color palettes that represent your common operating states"
Users review all five palettes, each containing personalized descriptions relevant to their personality type
Users select exactly two palettes that best match their common mental/emotional states
After selecting two palettes, a horizontal color-mixing slider appears
Users adjust this slider to indicate the percentage distribution between their selected states (e.g., 70% Very Good, 30% Average)
As users make selections and adjust the slider, their personality tower visualization updates in real-time, showing the color gradient being applied

State Content Personalization
Each palette card displays personalized content based on the user's previously identified personality type. For example, a Type 1 (Reformer) seeing the "Very Good" state would read:
"I feel balanced and at peace with imperfection. I channel my natural eye for improvement into positive change without becoming stressed. I can prioritize what truly matters and let go of minor issues with grace."
While a Type 7 (Enthusiast) would see a different description for the same state:
"I experience joy fully while staying grounded in reality. I commit to meaningful experiences rather than chasing novelty. I face difficult emotions with the same enthusiasm I give to pleasure."
Color Blending Control
After selecting two states, users interact with a horizontal slider that:

Is 40px in height and spans the container width
Features a single circular handle (24px diameter)
Displays a gradient track matching the colors of the selected states (left to right)
Shows numerical percentages for both selected states (e.g., "70% / 30%")
Defaults to a 50/50 distribution
Visually represents a paint mixing tool blending the two selected colors

Tower Visualization Integration
As users make selections and adjust the distribution:

The personality tower visualization updates with smooth color transitions (0.5s)
The tower displays a gradient between the selected state colors
The color distribution visually reflects the percentage allocation set by the user
The experience creates a cohesive metaphor of painting/coloring their personality tower

This visually engaging approach transforms abstract psychological concepts into an intuitive, creative experience that helps users understand and interact with their personality states in a meaningful way.
