Critical Foundation Visualization Implementation Issues
After seeing the third screenshot, there are still fundamental misunderstandings about the Foundation Visualization design requirements. The current implementation doesn't match the technical specification in section 17.
Major Design Discrepancies:
1. Missing Circular Foundation Base:
   1.1. The specification clearly requires a visible circular foundation base (320px diameter)
   1.2. There is no visible circular element serving as the foundation base
   1.3. Stones should be arranged AROUND this circular base, not floating in space

2. Incorrect Stone Arrangement:
   2.1. Stones should be positioned around the perimeter of the circular foundation
   2.2. Current implementation shows stones floating in an arbitrary arrangement
   2.3. There's no clear circular pattern to the stone placement

3. Visual Metaphor Breakdown:
   3.1. The building metaphor requires stones to form a solid foundation
   3.2. Current visualization fails to convey "foundation building" concept
   3.3. The circular arrangement is essential to the visual metaphor
Explicit Implementation Instructions:
1. Create an explicit circular foundation base:
   - Add a visible circular element (320px diameter)
   - Use a light gray or subtle color for the circle
   - Position it centrally in the visualization area
   - This circle should be clearly visible as the "foundation"

2. Position stones correctly around the circle:
   - Place stones around the PERIMETER of the circle
   - Stones should be arranged in a circular pattern
   - Equally space stones around the circle's circumference
   - Each stone should touch or overlap with the circle's edge

3. Add connecting lines:
   - Draw visible lines from each stone to the center of the circle
   - These lines should create a "spoke" pattern
   - Lines should clearly connect stones to the foundation center

4. Use SVG for precise implementation:
   - Create an SVG container sized appropriately
   - Define the circle element for the foundation
   - Position stones at calculated points around the circle:
     ```javascript
     // For 9 stones around a circle:
     const radius = 160; // 320px diameter / 2
     const centerX = width / 2;
     const centerY = height / 2;
     
     // For each stone index (i) from 0 to 8:
     const angle = (i * (2 * Math.PI / 9)); // Divide circle into 9 parts
     const stoneX = centerX + radius * Math.cos(angle);
     const stoneY = centerY + radius * Math.sin(angle);
     
     // Position stone at (stoneX, stoneY)
     ```
Visual Reference Clarification:
The foundation should look like a wheel with:

A circular "hub" (the foundation base)
"Spokes" (connecting lines from stones to center)
Stones positioned around the edge like points on a clock face

The current implementation completely misses this wheel-like structure, which is fundamental to the foundation visualization concept.
Please prioritize fixing the basic structure before animations or other details. The correct arrangement must be implemented first.
