## ❗️What Needs Fixing (with Spec References)

### 1. ❌ Limit State Selection to Exactly **Two States**
- **Spec Reference:**  
  `Section 1.2 Core Concepts` — Under “Building Metaphor” and  
  `Section 1.3 User Journey Flow` → Color Palette Adjustment implies a **2-state balance model**.

- **Requirement:**  
  - Only 2 sliders should be adjustable.  
  - The 3rd state must be auto-calculated: `100 - (State1 + State2)`

- **Fix:**  
  - Use toggles to select exactly two active sliders.  
  - Disable the third slider.  
  - Dynamically recalculate its value.

### 2. ❌ Tower Visualization Not Reflecting State Percentages
- **Spec Reference:**  
  `Section 1.2 Core Concepts → Visual Feedback` and  
  `Section 22.4.1 Individual Exports → PNG image of tower visualization`

- **Requirement:**  
  - Tower must visually reflect state proportions:
    - **Green** = Healthy
    - **Blue** = Average
    - **Red** = Unhealthy

- **Fix:**  
  - Proportional block heights or segmented colored slices based on percentages  
  - Consider animated transitions

---

### 3. ❌ No Slider Validation or Feedback Logic
- **Spec Reference:**  
  `Section 24.2.2 Mobile User Experience → Input Optimization + Visual Adaptations`

- **Requirement:**  
  - Real-time tooltip or inline feedback (e.g., “You spend 45% in Average and 40% in Healthy”)  
  - Enforce only 2 active sliders

- **Fix:**  
  - Dynamic feedback above sliders  
  - Error prevention logic for third slider

---

### 4. ❌ Backend Storage of State Distribution
- **Spec Reference:**  
  `Section 23 Development and Deployment Workflow`

- **Requirement:**  
  - Save state distribution values (e.g., 40% Healthy, 45% Average, 15% Unhealthy) to user profile in DB

- **Fix:**  
  - Store state data during Phase 3 (Color Palette) in database for future exports and reports
