// Placeholder for Report Generation Service
// This service will encapsulate the logic for generating personality reports.
// It will likely:
// - Take comprehensive assessment data as input.
// - Utilize the 'reportGenerator.js' utility (or its TypeScript equivalent).
// - Format the report content (text, insights, data for charts).
// - Interact with User model to fetch necessary user details if needed for the report.
