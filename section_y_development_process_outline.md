## Section Y: Proposed Development Process Outline

### Y.1 Introduction

This section outlines a proposed development process for the Inner DNA Assessment System. The approach is iterative and modular, allowing for progressive development, testing, and refinement of each system component. This phased strategy aims to manage complexity, facilitate parallel work where possible, and ensure key functionalities are delivered and validated incrementally. Regular review and adaptation of this plan are expected as the project evolves.
